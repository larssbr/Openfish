Openfish is a open source project

Openfish is part of "Lars Brusletto" master thesis. 

It will consist of a robotic snake, that with 3d printed parts will look like a fish.
Its purpuse is to create a robot fish that will swim like a fish, and be able to swim into a school of fish and infiltrate the groups decision. 

This project will start by:

1 creating a simulator

2 test the simulator up against a real swimming fish equiped with sensors

3 make a real life snake robot that will mimic the real swimming fish behaviour. 

4 make control system for snake robot

5 3D print parts for the robotsnake so it looks more like a real fish.

6 DO systemIdentification of the robofish, to calibrate control system for snake-fish robot

7 Include AI, to make the robo-fish infiltrate school, and change its direction
